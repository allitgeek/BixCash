### ‚úÖ Test #6: Partner Dashboard Customer Search (PASSED)

**Objective**: Test partner's ability to search for customers by phone number

**Test Date**: October 16, 2025 at ~20:05 UTC
**Test Method**: Browser-based manual testing

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as partner to https://bixcash.com/partner/dashboard
2. Click "New Transaction" button
3. Enter customer phone: 3023772000
4. Click "Search Customer"
5. Verify customer information displayed

**Initial Issue**: "Network error. Please try again." displayed after search

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Checked browser console - no JavaScript errors visible initially
2. Verified customer exists in database
3. Checked Network tab - all requests returning 200 OK
4. Added detailed console logging to JavaScript
5. User shared console output showing:
   ```
   Error in searchCustomer: TypeError: customer.stats.total_spent.toFixed is not a function
   ```

**Root Cause Discovered**: JavaScript Type Error
- Backend returned `total_spent` as a string (from SQL `sum()` function)
- JavaScript code called `.toFixed()` method on string
- `.toFixed()` only exists on Number objects, not strings

**Fix Applied**:
**File**: `/var/www/bixcash.com/backend/resources/views/partner/dashboard.blade.php`
**Line**: 532

```javascript
// BEFORE:
<p>Total Spent: Rs ${customer.stats.total_spent.toFixed(0)}</p>

// AFTER:
<p>Total Spent: Rs ${parseFloat(customer.stats.total_spent || 0).toFixed(0)}</p>
```

**Solution**:
- Added `parseFloat()` wrapper to convert string to number
- Added fallback to `0` for null/undefined values
- Ensures `.toFixed()` always operates on a number

**Test After Fix**:
1. Partner searched for customer: 3023772000
2. Customer information displayed correctly:
   - Name: Faisal
   - Phone: +923023772000
   - Total Purchases: 1
   - Total Spent: Rs 1000
3. No errors in console
4. Ready to proceed with transaction creation

**Result**: ‚úÖ PASSED
- Customer search working correctly
- Customer information displays properly
- Type conversion fix successful
- No network errors

**User Feedback**: "yes, it seems until here everything worked"

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Bug fixed, feature working

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/resources/views/partner/dashboard.blade.php` (line 532)

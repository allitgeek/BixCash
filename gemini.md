# BixCash Website Project Summary

This document outlines the work done so far on the BixCash single-page website.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To build a responsive single-page website based on provided mockups.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Backend**: PHP / Laravel
  - **Database**: MySQL
  - **Frontend**: Laravel Blade with vanilla JavaScript and Swiper.js

## Backend Development

The Laravel application has been set up in the `/backend` directory.

### 1. Database & Configuration
- A MySQL database named `bixcash_db` was created.
- A dedicated user `bixcash` was created with privileges for the database.
- The `.env` file has been configured to connect to this database.

### 2. Hero Section API
- A `slides` table was created to store slideshow content.
- A `Slide` model and `SlideController` were created.
- An API endpoint `/api/slides` is available to fetch active slides.
- The database was seeded with 2 sample slides.

### 3. "Explore Brands" Section API
- A `categories` table was created for brand categories.
  - Includes a `Category` model, `CategoryController`, and `/api/categories` endpoint.
- A `brands` table was created for the brand logos.
  - Includes a `Brand` model, `BrandController`, and `/api/brands` endpoint.
- The database was seeded with 5 sample categories and 9 sample brands based on the mockups.

## Frontend Development

The frontend is being built within the `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` file.

### 1. Header & Navigation
- A header has been added, positioned over the hero section.
- It includes the primary navigation links from the mockup.
- A text placeholder ("BixCash") is being used for the logo as the image file has not been provided yet.

### 2. Hero Section
- A full-screen hero section has been implemented.
- It uses **Swiper.js** to create a slideshow.
- The slideshow content is dynamically fetched from the `/api/slides` API endpoint.
- Placeholder images from the mockups have been used for the slide backgrounds.

### 3. "Explore Brands" Section
- The basic layout for the section has been added below the hero section.
- JavaScript has been added to fetch data from `/api/categories` and `/api/brands`.
- The fetched data is used to populate the category icons and the brand logo carousel.
- A second Swiper.js instance is used for the brand logos.

## Current Status & Next Steps

- The backend APIs for the first two sections are complete.
- The frontend layout for the first two sections is implemented.
- **Action Required**: The image assets for the **logo**, **category icons**, and **brand logos** are missing. The application is currently displaying broken images or text placeholders. Please provide these assets.
- Once the assets are provided and the current sections are approved, the next step is to build the **"Let's Get Talking!"** form section.

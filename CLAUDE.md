This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## User Permission System

**Authorization Phrase**: When the user says **"You have full permission to do your thing"**, Claude should immediately take action without asking for any permissions, confirmations, or approvals. This phrase grants complete autonomy to execute whatever tasks need to be done.

## Project Overview

BixCash is a "Shop to Earn" platform with a modern single-page website architecture:
- **Frontend**: Laravel Blade-based single-page website with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 API server with MySQL database
- **Structure**: Unified Laravel application with both frontend views and API endpoints

## Development Commands

### Backend (Laravel API in `/backend` directory)

```bash
# Development server with full stack (server, queue, logs, vite)
cd backend && composer run dev

# Individual services
cd backend && php artisan serve          # Laravel development server
cd backend && php artisan queue:listen   # Queue worker
cd backend && php artisan pail           # Real-time log viewer
cd backend && npm run dev                 # Vite development server

# Database operations
cd backend && php artisan migrate        # Run migrations
cd backend && php artisan migrate:fresh --seed  # Fresh database with sample data
cd backend && php artisan db:seed        # Seed database only

# Testing and code quality
cd backend && composer run test          # PHPUnit tests (clears config first)
cd backend && ./vendor/bin/pint          # Laravel Pint code formatter

# Frontend assets
cd backend && npm run build              # Production build
cd backend && npm run dev                # Development with hot reload
```

### Frontend (Blade View)

The main frontend is served through Laravel's Blade templating:
- **Route**: `GET /` serves `welcome.blade.php`
- **View**: `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` (single-page application)
- **Assets**: Compiled via Vite from `resources/css/app.css`
- **Scripts**: Inline JavaScript for API integration and UI interactions

## Architecture

### Database Schema

### Core Content Entities
- **Slides**: Hero carousel content with scheduling and targeting features
- **Categories**: Brand categorization with activation status and metadata
- **Brands**: Partner brand information with commission rates and partner associations

### Admin System Entities (Phase 2)
- **Roles**: Role-based permission system (super_admin, admin, moderator, partner, customer)
- **Users**: Extended with role relationships, activity tracking, and status management
- **AdminProfile**: Admin-specific data (department, permissions, login history)
- **CustomerProfile**: Customer data (earnings, referrals, verification status)
- **PartnerProfile**: Business partner information (approvals, commission rates, sales data)

### API Endpoints

#### Public API Endpoints (`/backend/routes/api.php`)

### Models and Controllers

#### Core Models
- **Slide**, **Category**, **Brand**: Enhanced with admin features, relationships, and scopes
- **User**: Extended with role-based access control and profile relationships
- **Role**: Permission-based access control system

#### Admin Models (Phase 2)

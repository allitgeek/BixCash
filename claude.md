## Recent Development Session (October 14, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Main Achievement: Customer Phone Authentication System

Implemented a complete phone-based authentication system with Firebase OTP and PIN login:

#### Features Implemented

1. **Phone-Based Authentication**
   - E.164 phone format validation (+92XXXXXXXXXX for Pakistan)
   - Firebase OTP generation and verification
   - 6-digit OTP with 5-minute expiry
   - Rate limiting: 30-second resend delay, 10 OTPs per day

2. **PIN Authentication**
   - 4-digit numeric PIN for quick login
   - Bcrypt hashing for security
   - Lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 minutes)
   - Smart login flow: existing users with PIN skip OTP

3. **Smart Login Flow**
   - System checks if phone number has PIN set
   - Users with PIN â†’ direct to PIN login screen
   - Users without PIN â†’ OTP verification flow
   - New users â†’ OTP verification + PIN setup

4. **PIN Reset Flow**
   - "Forgot PIN" triggers OTP verification
   - OTP verified once, then used for PIN reset
   - Allows already-verified OTPs (fixed double-verification bug)

5. **Admin Panel Enhancements**
   - Firebase configuration UI (save service account JSON)
   - Customer management (list, view, edit, block/unblock)
   - Firebase credentials stored in storage/app/firebase/

6. **Security Features**
   - Security event logging (failed logins, lockouts, suspicious activity)
   - IP blocking middleware
   - Rate limiting on all auth endpoints
   - Smart rate limiting: only counts unverified OTPs

## Bugs Fixed Today

### 1. HTTP 500 - Site Down (RateLimiter Issue)
**Problem**: RateLimiter::for() called in bootstrap/app.php middleware closure before facade ready
**Solution**: Created RateLimitServiceProvider and moved rate limiter config to boot() method
**Files**: `bootstrap/app.php`, `app/Providers/RateLimitServiceProvider.php`

### 2. Firebase Config Permission Denied
**Problem**: Web server couldn't write to .env file
**Solution**: Changed ownership and permissions (chown www-data:www-data, chmod 664)
**Files**: `.env`, `storage/app/firebase/`

### 3. OTP Rate Limiting Too Aggressive
**Problem**: Old verified OTPs blocking new requests
**Solution**: Only count unverified OTPs in rate limiting, hourly limit instead of daily
**Files**: `app/Services/FirebaseOtpService.php`

### 4. User Creation Failed - Email Required
**Problem**: Database required email field but phone-only registration didn't provide it
**Solution**: Created migration to make email field nullable
**Files**: `database/migrations/2025_10_14_145050_make_email_nullable_in_users_table.php`

### 5. User Creation Failed - Password Required
**Problem**: Database required password field but phone-only registration didn't provide it
**Solution**: Created migration to make password field nullable
**Files**: `database/migrations/2025_10_14_145436_make_password_nullable_in_users_table.php`

### 6. OTP Verification Failed - createToken() Undefined
**Problem**: User model missing HasApiTokens trait for Sanctum
**Solution**: Added `use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;` trait to User model
**Files**: `app/Models/User.php`

### 7. PIN Reset - OTP Already Verified Error
**Problem**: OTP verified on first screen, then re-verified on PIN save (fails because already used)
**Solution**: Added `allowAlreadyVerified` parameter to verifyOtp() to accept already-verified OTPs
**Files**: `app/Services/FirebaseOtpService.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Auth/CustomerAuthController.php`

### 8. Frontend Not Storing Verified OTP
**Problem**: Frontend verified OTP but didn't pass it to save PIN request
**Solution**: Added `this.verifiedOtp` variable to store OTP after verification
**Files**: `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`

---

## Testing Credentials

### Test Phone Number
- Phone: `+923023772000` (or enter as `3023772000`)
- Current PIN: `1234`

### Admin Access
- URL: https://bixcash.com/admin/login
- Use your existing admin credentials

### Development OTP Retrieval
```bash
# Get latest OTP for any phone
php artisan otp:latest

# Get latest OTP for specific phone
php artisan otp:latest +923023772000
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **SMS Not Integrated**: OTPs are stored in database only (no SMS sent)
   - Development mode: Use `php artisan otp:latest` to retrieve OTPs
   - Production ready: Need to integrate Twilio or Firebase Phone Auth

2. **Rate Limiting**: Some endpoints have aggressive rate limiting
   - If you hit "Too Many Attempts", wait 1-2 minutes
   - Rate limits: 5-20 requests/minute depending on endpoint

3. **Firebase Configuration**: Service account JSON must be valid
   - Stored in `storage/app/firebase/service-account.json`
   - Configure via Admin Settings page

---

## Next Steps / TODO

### Phase 11: SMS Integration (Not Started)
- [ ] Choose SMS provider (Twilio vs Firebase Phone Auth)
- [ ] Integrate SMS sending in FirebaseOtpService
- [ ] Test SMS delivery in production
- [ ] Add SMS delivery logging

### Phase 12: Customer App Features (Not Started)
- [ ] Browse brands and categories
- [ ] Make purchases and track cashback
- [ ] Wallet and transaction history
- [ ] Withdrawal requests

### Phase 13: Partner Portal (Not Started)
- [ ] Partner registration and onboarding
- [ ] Offer creation and management
- [ ] Analytics and reporting
- [ ] Commission settings

### Phase 14: Testing & QA (Ongoing)
- [x] Unit tests for auth services
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for customer flows
- [ ] Security audit

---

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- All OTP operations are logged to security_logs table
- Failed login attempts trigger security logging
- PIN lockouts are logged with attempt counts
- IP addresses can be blocked via CheckBlockedIp middleware

### Performance Optimizations
- Config/route/view caching enabled in production
- Composer autoloader optimized
- Queue workers handle background jobs
- Database indexes on phone numbers and timestamps

### Maintenance
- Queue workers monitored by Supervisor (auto-restart)
- Laravel scheduler runs via cron every minute
- SSL certificates auto-renew via Certbot
- Logs rotated by Laravel (daily rotation)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 500 Error on Login
**Check**:
1. Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Apache logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log`
3. Clear caches: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear`

### Issue: OTP Not Generating
**Check**:
1. Firebase credentials: `ls -la storage/app/firebase/`
2. Firebase config: `php artisan tinker` â†’ `config('firebase.credentials.file')`
3. OTP service: `php artisan tinker` â†’ `app(App\Services\FirebaseOtpService::class)`

### Issue: Rate Limit Errors
**Solution**:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for rate limit to reset
2. Clear OTP records: `php artisan tinker` â†’ `App\Models\OtpVerification::truncate();`
3. Check rate limit config: `config/firebase.php`

### Issue: Queue Jobs Not Processing
**Check**:
1. Queue workers: `sudo supervisorctl status`
2. Restart workers: `sudo supervisorctl restart laravel-worker:*`
3. Check failed jobs: `php artisan queue:failed`
